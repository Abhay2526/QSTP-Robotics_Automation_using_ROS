# Week 2

Welcome to Week 2! Now that you have set up your development environment and gotten familiar with python and various other tools,  you are ready to dive into ROS!

The main aims for this week -
1. Understanding basic ROS concepts and implementing simple examples
2. Getting familiar with the Gazebo Simulation environment and Turtlebot

The learning material will be released in two parts - the first part explaining the basics of ROS and the second part will be focused on the Gazebo simulator and Turtlebot3 package.

_Note : This week might be a bit difficult to understand as this will be your first introduction to certain concepts and terminologies. You might encounter some jargon on your way too. But do not get intimidated by these things. We have tried to keep the explanation as simple as possible but certain things may still confuse you. Do not worry if you donâ€™t understand some things and keep asking doubts on the group. Be assured that these things will definitely get clearer as you proceed further in the course. It gets much easier once you get past the initial phase of understanding the basics._


## Getting Started with ROS

ROS is an integral tool for most Robotics Automation Projects. It provides a collection of very useful tools and frameworks to make building projects much easier. Introductions to all the basic concepts as well as a collection of resources are given in ROS-Basics.pdf

Apart from this the two main resources you should use are -
-  _Programming Robots with ROS, by Morgan Quigley, Brian Gerkey and William D. Smart_: First 4 Chapters + Chapter 20
- [_ROSwiki_](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials): Beginner Level tutorials

Following and implenting the examples in either one should be suffiecient.

By the end of the week you should  -

1. Understand what ROS is and why it exists (Short explanation: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1qT85pTW0w&feature=youtu.be), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UL1_Ue4rUWs))
2. Understand Publisher-Subscriber Model and implementing a basic example (**Chapter 3** of Morgan Quigley)
3. Understand Server-Client Model and implementing a basic example (**Chapter 4** of Morgan Quigley)
4. Get familiar with ROS related command line tools such as `catkin`, `rosrun`, `roslaunch`, `roscd` (**Chapter 20** of Morgan Quigley)


## Robotics Simulation

Simulation is an important part of robotics since its lets us quickly deploy and test our code. It will be heavily used in this course to run and see visual results for all the code you write so its important to get familiar with the basics. A brief overvew of the Gazebo simulator and the turtlebot robot as well as how to implement basic functionality is given in Gazebo-Turtlebot-Intro.pdf

By the end of this week you shoud -

1. Understand the importance of simulation in robotics and know about the various available plaforms (**Chapter 6** of Morgan Quigley)
2. Be comfortable with the turtlebot3 platform in gazebo (Turtlebot3 documentation: [1](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/#turtlebot3-simulation-using-gazebo))
2. Be able to write a ROS node to control turtlebot in gazebo (Short guide: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEwi1__NJrE))

We reccomend that you play around with Turtlebot3 in gazebo yourself to get comfortable with the platform.
