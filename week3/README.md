# Week 3

Welsome to Week 3. So far you have set up your ROS development environment and learnt how to work with basic ROS and simulate Turtlebot in Gazebo. Now it's time to move on to the next aspect of controlling the movement of our robot : **Control Theory**. The main aims for this week will be:

1. Get familiar with the basics of control theory
2. Understand how a differential drive robot works
3. Study the Proportional, Integral and Derivative (PID) controller

_Note : Although control theory is a very vast subject, the reading material for this week will be relatively shorter as compared to the previous weeks as we won't be needing a detailed study of the subject for the project._

## Resources

If you find yourself interested in the subject of control theory, these ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBc_BHxw78s&list=PLUMWjy5jgHK1NC52DXXrriwihVrYZKqjk),[2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNR20Mz-VpzgfQs5zrYi085m)) video series by Brian Douglas and Steve Brunton are good comprehenensive resources to get started with.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn8PRpmsu08pQBgjxYFXSsODEF3Jqmm-y) playlist by mathworks is a good place to understand the working of the PID controller.

By the end of the week you will be able to :

1. Understand the dynamics of movement of the turtlebot - a differential      drive bot
2. Perform certain control tasks on the turtlebot using the PID controller
